# FFTV
FFTV (FFmpeg File To Video) is a simple bash script that converts raw data of files into videos (very original I know).

This is a repo for a bash script which has 2 styles of visuals one taken from the ffmpeg command in Reycko's batch script in their repo https://github.com/Reycko/FFTAAV although they also provide the ffmpeg command in their video descriptions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmwBjMwZrZw such as this video and the other taken from the ffmpeg command in the description of SBoys3's videos, like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy6A4az4Pjw.

Other than that all the shitty bash scripting is done by me.
